Third-party extensions can be used to enhance the testing experience with other frameworks. The goal of inline-snapshot is to provide the core functionality for many different use cases.

List of current third-party extensions:

- [inline-snapshot-django](https://pypi.org/project/inline-snapshot-django/) Extensions for using inline-snapshot to test Django projects.
- [inline-snapshot-pandas](https://pypi.org/project/inline-snapshot-pandas/) pandas integration for inline-snapshot (insider only)

How to add your extension to this list?

Your package name has to start with `inline-snapshot-` or end with `-inline-snapshot` and has to be available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org). The summary of your package will be used as description.

I will update this list from time to time but you can accelerate this process by creating a new [issue](https://github.com/15r10nk/inline-snapshot/issues).
