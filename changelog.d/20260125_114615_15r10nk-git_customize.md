### Added

- Support for import statement generation for all types and user-customized code.
- Added a new way to customize snapshot creation with `@customize`.
- Added a plugin system which allows you to reuse customizations across multiple projects.
- Added built-in handlers for `datetime.datetime`, `date`, `time`, and `timedelta` that generate clean snapshots with proper imports.
- Added support for conditional external storage to automatically store values in external files based on custom criteria (e.g., string length, data size).
- Generates `__file__` instead of the filename string of the current source file.
- Uses dirty-equals `IsNow()` instead of the current datetime when the time value equals the current time.
