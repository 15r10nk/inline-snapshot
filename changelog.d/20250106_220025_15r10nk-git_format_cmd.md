### Added

- You can now specify which tool you want to use to format your code by setting a `format-command` in your [configuration](https://15r10nk.github.io/inline-snapshot/latest/configuration/#format-command).

### Changed

- **BREAKING-CHANGE** you have to install `inline-snapshot[black]` now if you want to format your code like in the previous versions. This option is not required if you use a `format-command`.
