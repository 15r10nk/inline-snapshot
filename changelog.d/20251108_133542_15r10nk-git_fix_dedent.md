### Fixed

- `--inline-snapshot=update` now ignores added `textwrap.dedent` calls like this and will no longer try to change your code back (this issue only occurred when updates were enabled in the config).

``` python
from textwrap import dedent
from inline_snapshot import snapshot


def test_dedent():
    assert "a\nb\n" == snapshot(
        dedent(
            """\
            a
            b
            """
        )
    )
```
