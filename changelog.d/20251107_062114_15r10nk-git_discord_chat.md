### Fixed

- Format commands with pipelines (using `|`) now properly fail when any command in the pipeline returns a non-zero exit code ([#320](https://github.com/15r10nk/inline-snapshot/issues/320)). Previously, only the last command's exit code was considered, which could allow formatting to succeed even when intermediate commands failed.
