### Removed

- removed the `"Programming Language :: Python :: Implementation :: PyPy"` classifier which was incorrect, because inline-snapshot can not fix snapshots on pypy.
  inline-snapshot now enforces `--inline-snapshot=disable` when used with an implementation other than cpython, which allows it to be used in packages that want to support pypy.
