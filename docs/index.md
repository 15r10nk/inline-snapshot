# Welcome to inline-snapshot

inline-snapshot can be used for different things:

* golden master/approval/snapshot testing.
  The idea is that you have a function with a currently unknown result and you want to write a tests, which ensures that the result does not change during refactoring.
* Compare things which are complex like lists with lot of numbers or complex data structures.
* Things which might change during the development like error messages.


`inline-snapshot` automates the process of recording, storing and updating the value you want to compare with.
The value is converted with `repr()` and stored in the source file as argument of the `snapshot()` function.

## Usage

You can use `snapshot()` instead of the value which you want to compare with and run the tests to record the correct values.

=== "original code"

    <!-- inline-snapshot: first_block outcome-passed=1 outcome-errors=1 -->
    ``` python
    from inline_snapshot import snapshot


    def something():
        return 1548 * 18489


    def test_something():
        assert something() == snapshot()
    ```


=== "--inline-snapshot=create"

    <!-- inline-snapshot: create outcome-passed=1 -->
    ``` python hl_lines="9"
    from inline_snapshot import snapshot


    def something():
        return 1548 * 18489


    def test_something():
        assert something() == snapshot(28620972)
    ```

Your tests will break, if you change your code by adding `// 18`.
Maybe that is correct and you should fix your code, or
your code is correct and you want to update your test results.

=== "changed code"
    <!-- inline-snapshot: outcome-failed=1 outcome-errors=1 -->
    ``` python hl_lines="2"
    def something():
        return (1548 * 18489) // 18


    def test_something():
        assert something() == snapshot(28620972)
    ```


=== "--inline-snapshot=fix"
    <!-- inline-snapshot: fix outcome-passed=1 -->
    ``` python hl_lines="6"
    def something():
        return (1548 * 18489) // 18


    def test_something():
        assert something() == snapshot(1590054)
    ```

Please verify the new results. `git diff` will give you a good overview over all changed results.
Use `pytest -k test_something --inline-snapshot=fix` if you only want to change one test.


## Supported operations

You can use `snapshot(x)` like you can use `x` in your assertion with a limited set of operations:

- [`value == snapshot()`](eq_snapshot.md) to compare with something,
- [`value <= snapshot()`](cmp_snapshot.md) to ensure that something gets smaller/larger over time (number of iterations of an algorithm you want to optimize for example),
- [`value in snapshot()`](in_snapshot.md) to check if your value is in a known set of values,
- [`snapshot()[key]`](getitem_snapshot.md) to generate new sub-snapshots on demand.

!!! warning
    One snapshot can only be used with one operation.
    The following code will not work:
    <!-- inline-snapshot: first_block show_error outcome-failed=1 -->
    ``` python
    def test_something():
        s = snapshot(5)
        assert 5 <= s
        assert 5 == s


    # Error:
    # >       assert 5 == s
    # E       TypeError: This snapshot cannot be use with `==`, because it was previously used with `x <= snapshot`
    ```

## Supported usage

It is possible to place `snapshot()` anywhere in the tests and reuse it multiple times.


=== "original code"

    <!-- inline-snapshot: first_block outcome-passed=2 outcome-errors=2 -->
    ``` python
    def something():
        return 21 * 2


    result = snapshot()


    def test_something():
        ...
        assert something() == result


    def test_something_again():
        ...
        assert something() == result
    ```

=== "--inline-snapshot=create"

    <!-- inline-snapshot: create outcome-passed=2 -->
    ``` python hl_lines="5"
    def something():
        return 21 * 2


    result = snapshot(42)


    def test_something():
        ...
        assert something() == result


    def test_something_again():
        ...
        assert something() == result
    ```

`snapshot()` can also be used in loops:

=== "original code"
    <!-- inline-snapshot: first_block outcome-passed=1 outcome-errors=1 -->
    ``` python
    def test_loop():
        for name in ["Mia", "Eva", "Leo"]:
            assert len(name) == snapshot()
    ```
=== "--inline-snapshot=create"
    <!-- inline-snapshot: create outcome-passed=1 -->
    ``` python hl_lines="3"
    def test_loop():
        for name in ["Mia", "Eva", "Leo"]:
            assert len(name) == snapshot(3)
    ```

or passed as an argument to a function:


=== "original code"
    <!-- inline-snapshot: first_block outcome-passed=1 outcome-errors=1 -->
    ``` python
    def check_string_len(string, snapshot_value):
        assert len(string) == snapshot_value


    def test_string_len():
        check_string_len("abc", snapshot())
        check_string_len("1234", snapshot())
        check_string_len(".......", snapshot())
    ```

=== "--inline-snapshot=create"
    <!-- inline-snapshot: create outcome-passed=1 -->
    ``` python hl_lines="6 7 8"
    def check_string_len(string, snapshot_value):
        assert len(string) == snapshot_value


    def test_string_len():
        check_string_len("abc", snapshot(3))
        check_string_len("1234", snapshot(4))
        check_string_len(".......", snapshot(7))
    ```
